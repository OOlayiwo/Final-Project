## Description
This dashboard delivers real-time stock insights using Polygon and Frankfurter APIs, featuring an interactive ticker and diverse charts. This crucial, up-to-the-minute data empowers both small investors and financial analysts in their market decisions.
## Targeted Browsers 

### Android Users (Chrome)

* Chrome is the go-to browser for many Android users, and your website is designed to shine on this platform. We've rigorously tested and optimized scaling for charts and interactive elements across the diverse range of Android screen sizes and resolutions. 
* Furthermore, through techniques like conditional CSS and optimized file sizes, we ensure a smooth experience even on Android devices with lower hardware capabilities.

### Desktop Users (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox)

* While our design and scope are initially optimized for desktop users, providing an ideal experience for viewing detailed charts and in-depth analytics on larger displays, we recognize the importance of accessibility across various platforms.
* Keyboard and mouse interactions such as hovering, shortcuts and persistent navigation provide an edge in usability.
